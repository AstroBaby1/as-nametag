**HUD Display Script**

This script provides a HUD (Heads-Up Display) feature for FiveM, inspired by the nametag system from *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP)*. The HUD displays the player’s health, armor, and name above their character in the game world. The design mimics the classic SAMP style, allowing players to see important health and armor information in a visually clear manner.

**Features:**
- **Health Bar**: Displays the player's health with a red bar above the character.
- **Armor Bar**: Shows the player's armor level with a white bar above the character.
- **Player Name**: Displays the player's name, fetched from the game’s framework or using FiveM’s native functions if using a standalone setup.
- **Configurable Command**: Toggle the HUD on and off using a command specified in the `Config` table.
- **Framework Support**: Compatible with different FiveM frameworks (QBCore, ESX) or standalone setups. Notifications are sent based on the selected framework.

**Usage:**
1. **Configuration**: Adjust the `Config` table to choose your framework and set the command name for toggling the HUD.
2. **Toggle HUD**: Use the configured command to enable or disable the HUD display. 

This script aims to enhance the gameplay experience by offering a familiar HUD layout reminiscent of the classic SAMP nametags, tailored for modern FiveM environments.
